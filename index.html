				Remote Work Will Save Us All
			</p>
			<p>
				As I write this, we're just over halfway through the far-off, futuristic world of 2014. Everyone has flying cars that pilot themselves. Androids cook us dinner and have yet to rise up against their fleshy slave masters. Poverty is non-existant, world peace has been attained, and all is right with the universe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alright. Not exactly.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the better part of ten years, I've been drifting from desk to desk, chair to chair, working largely on a contract basis for clients large and small. Everybody shows up around 8, perhaps 9, in the morning. We sit down at our desks, wake our screens, and for the most part, we do not talk to each other. When we do, it is on average for fifteen minutes per day. Meetings might bump this to sixty for someone involved with production.
			</p>
			<p>
				Seventeen years ago, I would converse with people around the globe via IRC. We would provide each other by conversing: entertainment, distraction, support, relief, friendship. Some of us even exchanged by mail non-perishable foods from our respective regions. This is around the time I began working with HTML, disassembling CNN.com instead of going to class. This was middle school, and I was lucky to have access to the tools that would afford me to fail by the standards of the traditional education system, but lay the groundwork for my career nearly ten years in advance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jump back to today. We have 50Mbit connections through our cell phones, tablets, and laptops. Cameras and microphones are built into each device, as is the software required for optimal communication, in the form of FaceTime and Hangouts. Alternatives like Skype are available for free.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite our advances, the traditional perspective lives on: work cannot be done efficiently&mdash;or at all&mdash;without every employee physically residing within a single physical location. A few small businesses&mdash;some of them wildly successful, such as <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>&mdash;reject this philosophy, decentralizing their workforce, reducing overhead, and wildly increasing productivity, morale, loyalty, and overall job satisfaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				We spend most of our lives working. It's time to stick up for ourselves and for the rest of the professional workforce. It's time to evolve. Each one of us has the motivation and responsibility to get in the car, or on the bike, bus, board&mdash;whatever&mdash;to get to the office in the morning, to work hard all day, to get home that evening. Somehow we do it all again the next day, and most of us retain sanity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Doesn't it follow that if we were afforded flexibility&mdash;that what matters is the work, not how and when it got done, but that it was done and done well&mdash;we would produce higher quality results? We could devote time and energy at their peaks instead of suffering through lulls in the day, scrambling to drink enough coffee to stay focused.
			</p>
			<p>
				We could even do the things we want to do with our lives. Could you imagine? For me, it's snowboarding every day with my friends, and working after I get home. Believe it or not, there are enough hours in the day to do both and still complete great projcets at about 40 hours a week.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our living situations would no longer be defined by our professions, but by our passions, our true selves. Why move away from family and friends into a beer can apartment with ever-rising rent in a city where you can't seem to make anything else work&mdash;friends, relationships, passions&mdash;except work?
			</p>
			<p>
				Those passions could be anything. Are you an artist? Does inspiration strike you in the middle of the day when your tools are on the other side of the metropolitan? Do you like to travel? Does it bother you that your vacations only let you see the world for one or two weeks at a time before you're sucked back into the grind?
			</p>
			<p>
				We can be healthier working remotely. We can stand at our workstations instead of sitting, and we won't have to give somebody a doctor's note just so we can stand instead of sit. We can exercise when we feel the urge. In my experience, it's at a few times during the day, and it's never in the morning or after I get home from work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine the reduction in overhead by decentralizing your office and allowing your employees to work remotely. You won't have an office network of computers to purchase or maintain. No electricity or real estate or other utilities. Everyone already has their own tools, internet connections, and working spaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine, instead of a swath of apathetic contractors holding on to their paychecks and office chairs for dear life, investing in a remote workforce that is loyal to and passionate about the business and their work because they're afforded a true modern lifestyle.
			</p>
			<p>
				We've all worked hard to prove ourselves. Life isn't just about getting paid and surviving with a roof and a little bit of food. It's about living up to the best of one's abilities and the pursuit of an individual's own definition of happiness.
